	<h2 class="fees">Our Mission</h2>
	<p>We seek support the mission of Rancho 3M by connecting individual donors with one or more kids at Rancho 3M who they can then sponsor for the year. </p>

	<p class="fees"> We also don't take out any administration fees from our sponsors donations</p> 

	<p> Meaning, <span class="percent">100%</span> of the sponsorship donations goes towards supporting these orphaned and abandoned kids' every day needs - such as food, clothing, housing, and medical expenses. </p>

		How did we start all this? 
	</h2>
	<p>
		In Jenna's freshamn year of highschool, she spent a week in Guadelupe, Mexico at the orphanage where she fell in love with the kids and the mission of this organization. Fast-forward to college where Jenna and Faith wanted to compete in an business competition called <a href="http://enactus.org/">Enactus</a>, and saw the perfect opportunity to help the Ranch.
