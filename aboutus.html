		<h2 class="fees">Our Mission</h2>
		<p>We seek support the mission of Rancho 3M by connecting individual donors with one or more kids at the Ranch who they can then sponsor for the year. </p>

		<p class="fees"> We also don't take out any administration fees from our sponsors donations</p> 

		<p> Meaning, <span class="percent">100%</span> of the sponsorship donations goes towards supporting these orphaned and abandoned kids' every day needs - such as food, clothing, housing, and medical expenses. </p>

		Our Partners

	<article>
		<p>Our sponsorship program works closely with the director of <a href="">Rancho 3M</a> and it's board members to support the work they are doing in Guadelupe.</p>

		<p>Additonally, to make our administration costs low, Covenant Life Church has generaously agreed to donate the accounting needed for our program.  This means we can ensure that your personal financial information is secure, and your donations are handled properly. It also explains why we send you to another site to finalize the sponsorship sign-up </p>
